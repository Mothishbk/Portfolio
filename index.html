    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <div class="item">
      <h3>Software Engineer – LTIMindtree (2021–2023)</h3>
      <p>As a Software Engineer at LTIMindtree, I specialized in observability, automation, and incident response across large-scale production systems. I developed proactive monitoring dashboards using Datadog, which significantly improved incident detection and system stability. I created a Flask-based automation tool with MySQL and API integrations, enhancing user experience and operational efficiency. I also played a key role in training L1 support teams, enabling independent alert resolution and reducing escalation rates. My work in log analysis and threat detection using Splunk supported effective security investigations. Additionally, I managed 24/7 system monitoring, maintained 99.9% uptime, and contributed to security incident triage, vulnerability management, and Azure-based infrastructure reliability.</p>
